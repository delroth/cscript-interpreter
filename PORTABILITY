Portability considerations for the cscript interpreter
======================================================

1. Endian considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I try to think about endian problems when programming this interpreter, but
as I don't have access to any big endian machine to test this at the
moment, there may be places where the endianness is not correctly swapped.

Inline functions are provided in the endian.hh file to swap from one endian
to the other.

2. Floating point types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a lot of places, we consider that floating point types are 32 bit wide
and can be placed in an union along with normal integer types. I'm not sure
if it is the case everywhere (actually, I'm pretty sure that at least one
strange platform will not agree with this behavior).
